## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

Though I rarely write my code in markdown documents, they're a great way to share the code and its output all at once. 

Below are the code chunks for recoding as we assigned in homework 1.

## Homework 1

#............................
# Births 2012 Analysis for EPID 799C
# Mike Dolan Fliss, August 2017
#............................
# (HW1.Q1)
# Aim: Does early prenatal care (<month 5) decrease the risk of preterm birth? 
#............................
# Project Notes & References:
# Birth Certificate Revisions: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vital_certificate_revisions.htm

# Libraries, directories, load data ####

library(tidyverse) # for ggplot, dplyr in HWX
library(lubridate) # for dates in HWX
library(tableone) # used in HWX

names(births) = tolower(names(births)) #drop names to lowercase
#..................................................
# (HW1.Q3) Notice all these nice blocks?  I like to 
# have a header at the top, and block comments at the bottom.

## (HW1.Q4) 
dim(births)

births_sample = births[sample(nrow(births), 1000), c("mage", "mdif", "visits", "wksgest", "mrace")]
ggpairs(births_sample) # later I'll demo how to use color here after some recoding.

# Recode Variables: Outcome, Exposure & Covariates ####

## (HW1.Q6) 

# Date variables
births$dob_d = ymd(births$dob) # leave dobmonth, day, year as is.
births$weeknum = week(births$dob_d) #thanks, lubridate!

### A. Outcome variables - to do later: double check with Sara!

### Gestational Age: weeks (716.A1.1)
hist(births$wksgest) #quick look
table(births$wksgest, useNA = "always") #table it
sd(births$wksgest)
quantile(births$wksgest, probs=c(.05,.95))
births$pwk = ifelse(births$wksgest>37, 17, births$wksgest-19.5) #A3.1 pwk - person time at risk.
table(births$wksgest, births$pwk) #TODO - this isn't right. See the 17.5 record.

# preterm variable - (716.A4.1) weird order here.
hist(births$wksgest)
births$hx_preterm = births$ppb #already exists as a hx of preterm birth.
table(cut(births$wksgest, breaks = c(0,19,36,99), labels =  c("too young", "preterm", "term"))) #should be no births too young at this point.
births$preterm_f = cut(births$wksgest, breaks = c(19,36,99), labels =  c("preterm", "term")) #should be no births too young at this point.
table(births$wksgest, births$preterm_f)
births$preterm = ifelse(births$preterm_f=="term", 0, 1) #as int, might use later.

### Prenatal / pnc5
summary(births$visits) # (716.A1.B1.1)
births$visits[births$visits==99] = NA
table(births$visits, useNA="always") #Looks ok
hist(births$visits)
births$mdif[births$mdif %in% c(99)] = NA # (716.A1.B2.1) pnc5
births$pnc5 = ifelse(births$mdif<=5, 1, 0) #NA carries forward
table(births$pnc5, births$mdif, useNA = "always")
births$pnc5_f = factor(births$pnc5, levels=0:1, labels = c("No PNC before 5 mo", "PNC starts in first 5 mo"))

### SMOKING - NOTE: We used to have CIGBEF and CIGDUR, not sure what happened. (716.A1.C9)
births$smoker = births$cigbef # retain old variable
births$smoker[births$smoker=="U"] = NA
births$smoker = ifelse(births$smoker == "N", 0, 1)
births$smoker_f = factor(births$smoker, levels=0:1, labels=c("Non smoker", "Smoker"))
table(births$smoker_f, useNA="always")

### sex (716.A1.C10)
table(births$sex)
births$sex[births$sex==9] = NA
births$sex = factor(births$sex, levels=1:2, labels=c("Male", "Female"))
table(births$sex)

### Race-eth: FIX Back out of using this formatter.
# Typically I might save these recodes in a csv file rather than have constants in my code...
formatter = read.csv("R format helper 2012.csv", stringsAsFactors=F) 
formatter[formatter$variable=="mrace",]
births$race_f = factor(births$mrace, levels = 1:4, 
                       labels=formatter[formatter$variable=="mrace",]$recode, 
                       ordered = T) # a few ways to do this.
births$raceeth = ifelse(births$mrace == 1 & births$methnic == "N", "WnH", 
                        ifelse(births$mrace == 1 & births$methnic == "Y", "WH", 
                               ifelse(births$mrace==2, "AA", 
                                      ifelse(births$mrace==3, "AI/AN", "Other"))))
births$raceeth_f = factor(births$raceeth, levels=c("WnH", "AA", "WH", "AI/AN", "Other"))
table(births$race_f, births$methnic, births$raceeth_f)

births$mage[births$mage == 99] = NA

table(births$wksgest)
births$wksgest[births$wksgest==99] = NA # Very common syntax
